# ----------------------------------

10 epochs, 128 batch size

• Regenerated dataset, with correct angular info; 63.8%
• Regenerated dataset, with zero angle info; 63.3%
• Regenerated dataset, with zero stat info; 53.8%

Tried new normalisation of stat info, by preprocessing z-scores of all stat features; 65.7%
