This folder builds upon the previous TBinnedHist by including angular information, along with smearing for each of these quantities, 
and introduces time smearing.

It also trials a FiLM network (Feature-wise Linear Modulation, Perez et al. 2018). This means that the network learns how much to amplify or suppress
each histogram feature depending on the incidence angle. Perhaps for shallow angles, certain channels are weighted less, or perhaps certain photon hit 
times are weighted less.
